Pixie contributors will be attending this year’s [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2022](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/) in Detroit, Michigan!

Come chat about open source observability for Kubernetes with Pixie’s core contributors at our booth in the [Project Pavilion](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/program/project-engagement/#project-pavilion).

Pixie contributors will also be speaking at the following events:

- [**OpenTelemetry or eBPF? That is the Question**](https://sched.co/1Auyh) ([eBPF Day](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cloud-native-ebpf-day-north-america/) - Monday, October 24, 2022 9:25 AM EDT)<br/><br/>
_In the observability space, OpenTelemetry and eBPF are two technologies that have been rapidly changing the landscape. So which should you use? In this session, we'll cover the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, and show how both approaches have a role to play._

- [**Tracing SSL/TLS Encrypted Microservices with eBPF**](https://sched.co/1Auyt) ([eBPF Day](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cloud-native-ebpf-day-north-america/) - Monday, October 24, 2022 11:15 AM EDT)<br/><br/>
_SSL/TLS adoption in the Cloud Native environments is growing rapidly. While great for security, the encryption in such environments pose a unique challenge for observability tools. Many traffic sniffing tools can only collect the encrypted data, which is of limited value to the application developer. In this talk, we present how eBPF can be used to trace SSL/TLS connections so that application developers can see important debugging attributes like the operation, endpoint and payload._

- [**When the Logs Just Don’t Cut It: Root-Causing Incidents Without Re-Deploying Prod**](https://sched.co/182IS) (Friday, October 28, 2022 2:00 PM EDT) <br/><br/>
_We’ve all been there: your pod is crash-looping, you check the logs and you realize you forgot to log something important - now you’re unable to figure out what went wrong. You try to reproduce the problem locally with no luck: it only seems to happen in production. What do you do? In this talk, I’ll show you how to magically collect this data using bpftrace. Bpftrace lets you capture lots of useful data (function arguments, return values, latencies of individual functions - just to name a few) without re-deploying pods._

Here are some of the events we'll be attending. We hope to see you at them, along with the many other exciting talks at Kubecon!

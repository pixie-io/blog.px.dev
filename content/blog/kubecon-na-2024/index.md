Pixie contributors will be attending this year’s KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2024!

Stop by our booth in the Project Pavilion to catch up, talk Pixie and snag a Pixienaut t-shirt!

Pixie contributors will also be speaking at the following events:

- [**Powering Automatic Authorization in Envoy Through Live Traffic Inspection**](https://sched.co/1i7pm) (Friday November 15, 2024 11:00 MST)<br/><br/>
Join us as we dive into how Pixie can power automatic authorization (AuthZ) in Envoy, showcasing a case study for how this can boostrap authorization in your service mesh.

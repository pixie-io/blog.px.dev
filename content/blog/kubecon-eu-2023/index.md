Pixie contributors will be attending this year’s KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2023 in person in Amsterdam, The Netherlands!

Come chat about open source observability for Kubernetes with Pixie’s core contributors at our booth in the Project Pavilion.

Pixie contributors will also be speaking at the following events:

- [**Pixie Project Meeting**](https://sched.co/1JWUd) (Tuesday April 18, 2023 11:00 CEST)<br/><br/>
We're excited to meet everyone at our office hours! We welcome all questions about Pixie, whether they're questions about what Pixie is, or low-level questions about Pixie's internal workings.

- [**Past, Present, and Future of eBPF in Cloud Native Observability**](https://sched.co/1Hyak) Wednesday, April 19, 2023 11:55 CEST)<br/><br/>
eBPF has long been promising in the cloud native ecosystem but has evolved significantly over the years. This talk will start off with a brief history of the past and how eBPF has developed to be what it is today. This leads us to the current state of things in the present space of observability. Next, we will outline how eBPF is safely used in a variety of open source, apache2 licensed, projects from Cilium Hubble, Pixie, to Parca, and others. Here we will also take a look at a simple demo on eBPF and how this can be run on a Kubernetes cluster and what we can find about that cluster just by using eBPF data. The last portion of the talk will discuss the future of observability using eBPF and where Frederic and Natalie think it will develop, which among other things will include how eBPF will enable correlation between different signals such as connecting distributed tracing with profiling data.

- [**Tutorial: Building an Open Source Observability Stack**](https://sched.co/1HyeB) (Friday, April 21, 2023 14:00 CEST)<br/><br/>
This tutorial offers attendees a quick way to experience open source observability for Kubernetes. The three basic pillars of observability are metrics, logs and traces. In the past, instrumenting an application to provide these signals could be a multi-month initiative. However, the latest and greatest in CNCF projects have taken this slog down to minutes. In this hands-on introduction to the FOP stack (Fluentbit, OpenTelemetry, Prometheus), we’ll show you how to go from zero observability to deep coverage in minutes. Next, we’ll dive into how you can utilize the OpenTelemetry format to analyze these diverse telemetry sources together when debugging incidents. Finally, we’ll go beyond metrics, traces and logs by adding Pixie to our (now) FOPP stack, and show how you can use progressive instrumentation to collect application profiles, kernel events, and even function tracing without any redeploys.

Here are some of the events we'll be attending. We hope to see you at them, along with the many other exciting talks at Kubecon!
